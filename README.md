# Reassign the Value of a Variable

## Article Section

A variable can change its value. 

After a value is assigned to a variable, you can reassign that variable to a different value.

For example:

```
var firstName = "Johnny"
firstName = "John"
```

At the above, a variable `firstName` is first declared with a **string** value `"Johnny"`.
Then, the `firstName` variable is reassigned with a different value `"John"`.

So now, the `firstName` is `"John"` instead of `"Johnny"`.

Therefore, **a variable's value can change itself**.
